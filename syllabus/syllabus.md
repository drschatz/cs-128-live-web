# Learning Objectives

At the end of the course, a successful student should be able to:

- Formulate, implement, and test algorithms to solve complex problems from simple specifications.
- Use object-oriented design to appropriately structure data and couple data and behavior.
- Organize, compile, and debug C++ projects.
- Understand the features of computer systems that make them useful for solving problems, including computation, memory, storage, and data access.

# Components

### Lecture

9 am \- 9:50 am Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in 1404 Siebel Center for Comp Sci.  
See the course calendar for specifics and updates.

Lecture will include clicker questions via \<insert clicker app\>. This is a free app you will need to download and use during lecture. Some clicker question points are based on participation, others on the correct answer (collaboration is allowed).

### Lab

Lab is intended to give you an opportunity to work with your peers on a challenging coding assignment. Labs are collaborative but everyone needs to submit their own assignment to get credit. You will have until the following Tuesday at 8pm to submit the work.

Points will be awarded for attendance and the lab activity. To receive attendance points you must be present at the lab for at least 1 hour 10 minutes of the allotted 1 hour 20 minutes of class.

### Homework

Homework is there to give you practice with the material you just learned in lecture. This is a great way of assessing your own knowledge as well as solidifying your understanding. Homework is always released after lecture and is due before the next class. For example, homework after Monday’s lecture is due Wednesday at 8:59am. There is limited collaboration allowed on the homework assignments. See the collaboration policy below for more details.

### MPs

There are two main goals of the MPs

1. To give you experience developing a bigger project. From planning, to writing, to testing.
1. To be a fun and cool application that you can show off to friends or family.

MPs have a no collaboration policy. See the collaboration policy below for more details. Exact deadlines and instructions can be found on the course website.

### Exams

Exams are a way to test your knowledge in a proctored environment. There are three 50 minute exams during the semester in the CBTF. The CBTF is a proctored testing center with multiple locations on campus. You will need to pre-register for a time slot at one of their locations for each exam window. For more information see their website, [https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students](https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students).

If you need accommodations for exams, please see the Students with Disabilities  
Section of the syllabus and upload your paper work here [https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres](https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres), at least 5 business days before the exam.

**Second Chance Exams**  
Exams are important but can also be scary\! That is why if you don’t receive a score you are happy with you may take the second chance exam the following week. Your final grade for that exam will be 10% of your lowest score and 90% of the highest score. For example, if you take Exam 2 and get 65% and then take the second chance Exam 2 and get 89%, your final grade for Exam 2 is 86.6%. If you take Exam 2 and get 90% and then take the second chance Exam 2 and get 75% your final grade for Exam 2 will be 88.5%. If you take Exam 2 and get 87% and do not take the second chance Exam 2, your final grade for Exam 2 is 87%.

Note, you must register for a time slot for the second chance exams just like you do for a normal exam. The second chance exam will be on the same material as the original exam but with different questions.

**Exam Schedule**  
Exams and second chance exams run from Tuesday \- Thursday, except for the second chance Exam 3 which runs from Monday \- Wednesday due to the end of the semester. Exams cover topics through and including that previous Friday.

Exam 1 \- 50 mins in the CBTF 09/24 \- 09/26  
Content \- Through and including material from 9/20  
Exam 1 Second Chance \- 50 Mins in the CBTF 10/01 \- 10/03

\*\*Note your points will be rounded up to the nearest whole number and the cutoffs may change slightly in your favor.

# How To Get Points

The table below describes how to get points for various components in the course. The max number of points per component is different from the available points for lecture, homework, and labs to allow for missed questions, assignments, and attendance. You cannot get more than the Max Points for any component.

| Component | Max Points | Available Points | Points / Instance                                           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

# Extension Policies

There are no extensions for homework or labs. However, as indicated in the table above, there is wiggle room for missing assignments or partial credit.

Each MP part is due at 8pm on the deadline indicated on the specifications for that MP. However, you may turn in any part 24 hours late for a 10 point reduction on that part.

\*If you have extenuating circumstances please contact me. **Unless you were unable to do so, you must contact me BEFORE the deadline to get any relevant accommodations for that assignment or exam.\***

# How to Get Help

Computer science is challenging but the 128 team is here to help\!

## Office Hours

This is a space to come and ask questions and get clarification on course material and assignments. It is normal to come to office hours at least once a week and often more. They will be held virtually and in-person in the basement of Siebel Center for Computer Science. The exact schedule can be found on the course website.

## Discuss Online Forum

Link is on the website. Feel free to post any quick questions you have on there. However, do not post your code for homeworks, labs, or MPs.

We will do our best to answer your questions as quickly as possible but do not expect an instant response. You may also contribute and answer questions\! This is a great way to solidify your own understanding. However, remain respectful of everyone’s diverse backgrounds and abilities. We are all here to learn\!

## Meet with the Professor

If you are struggling in the course and are not sure how to proceed please reach out to Prof. Schatz via email. I can help you figure out what is going wrong and how to improve from there (I do this for students often).

# Proffice Hours (Professor Office Hours)

Wednesday after lecture, 10 \- 11 am in Prof. Schatz’s office 2330 Siebel Center for Computer Science. Come say “hi” and check out my lego collection\! I’m happy to answer big picture questions about the course or CS in general or just get to know you a bit better. This is a great opportunity to make a connection with a professor at UIUC.

My office is a bit hard to find… There is a map above\!

# Collaboration/Academic Integrity Policy

Below are the definitions of the two collaboration policies I have for various components. Please note it is always against the academic integrity policy to try and circumvent the autograder.

## Limited Collaboration Allowed

This means you may work with others to complete the component. However, **you must still submit your own code for grading**.

I recommend implementing buddy programming. This is where everyone codes on their own computer but you may look at and discuss code together. This lets you work together while still forcing you to write the code for yourself. This is important for learning and doing well on the exams\!

You may use AI systems for general conceptual questions but not for solutions or specifics. Remember why you are in this course as well as why you are furthering your education. Using AI to get answers may not be helpful for those goals.

**_Components this policy applies to: Lecture clicker questions, lab, and homework._**

## Collaboration NOT Allowed

**This means you must complete the component on your own**. You may NOT ask anyone besides a current course staff member for help. You may NOT use AI on these components. You may NOT look at another student's code NOR share your code with other students. Violating this policy is violating the academic integrity policy and will result in a FAIR violation. A violation can lead to a zero grade on the assignment and a full letter grade reduction in the course.

For exams you must follow the CBTF policy on what is allowed and what is not allowed. Deviations from this will result in an academic integrity violation.

**_Components this policy applies to: MPs, and Exams._**

# Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

As the state’s premier public university, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s core mission is to serve the interests of the diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived experiences of a diverse community and global workforce.

We support diversity of worldviews, histories, and cultural knowledge across a range of social groups including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, age, religion, and their intersections. The Grainger College of Engineering recognizes that we are learning together in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, that Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous voices and contributions have largely either been excluded from, or not recognized in, science and engineering, and that both overt racism and microaggressions threaten the well-being of our students and our university community.

This course and its social resources like Piazza should be a safe and encouraging learning environment that allows for the open exchange of ideas while also ensuring equitable opportunities and respect for all. Everyone is expected to help establish and maintain an environment where students, staff, and faculty can contribute without fear of personal ridicule, or intolerant or offensive language. If you witness or experience racism, discrimination, microaggressions, or other offensive behavior, you are encouraged to bring this to the attention of the course director or the course staff either directly or anonymously. You can also report these behaviors to the Campus Belonging Office [link](https://diversity.illinois.edu/diversity-campus-culture/belonging-resources/) or CS CARES [link](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/cs-cares).

# Students with Disabilities

Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES), a unit of the College of Applied Health Sciences, serves as the designated office of the University that coordinates campus-wide services for students with disabilities. DRES obtains and files disability documentation, certifies eligibility for services, and coordinates the planning and provision of auxiliary aids as well as the implementation of modifications and adjustments in academic rules, policies and procedures. Professional staff are available at DRES to provide University students with disability-related consultation and to assist them in obtaining both academic and nonacademic support and services.

Any student with a disability who may need accommodations in this class should obtain an accommodation letter from the Disability Resources and Education Services (DRES) Office. **Accommodations should be made known early in the semester and cannot be retroactively applied to assignments due before the time the accommodation was made known**.

# Statement on Mental Health

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional well-being. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or someone you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly encouraged to contact or visit any of the University’s resources provided below. **_Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do – for yourself and for those who care about you._**
